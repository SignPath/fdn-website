SignPath Foundation provides Open Source projects with code signing certificates through [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/). (Read more about how certificates are issued and provided [here]().)

SignPath Foundation is currently operated by [SignPath GmbH](https://about.signpath.io/company), the company behind SignPath.io. The use of the name SignPath reflects our commitment and our trust in the security of our product and the [promises conveyed by a SignPath Foundation certificate](). 

With increasing community interest and participation, we hope that SignPath Foundation will eventually become an independent entity, and that it will define and execute its own [policies for accepting projects]().

Web site powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/SignPath/fdn-website).
