# High-performance TightVNC-compatible Unix remote desktop software suitable for 3D and video applications

TurboVNC is a high-speed derivative of TightVNC and TigerVNC that contains some unique features, such as built-in VNC session management, an integrated SSH client, and one-time password support.  TurboVNC uses a variant of Tight encoding that is tuned to maximize performance for image- intensive applications (such as VirtualGL, video applications, and image editors) while still providing excellent performance for other types of applications.
