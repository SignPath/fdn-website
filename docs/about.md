header: About SignPath Foundation
---

SignPath Foundation provides Open Source projects with code signing certificates through [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/).

SignPath Foundation is currently operated by [SignPath GmbH](https://about.signpath.io/company), the company behind SignPath.io. The use of the name SignPath reflects our commitment and our trust in the security of our product and the [promises conveyed by a SignPath Foundation certificate](/terms#signpath-foundation-certificate-promises). 

With increasing community interest and participation, we hope that SignPath Foundation will eventually become an independent entity, and that it will define and execute its own [policies for accepting projects](/terms).

Web site powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/SignPath/fdn-website).
