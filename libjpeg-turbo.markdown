# SIMD-accelerated JPEG codec that provides both the libjpeg and TurboJPEG APIs

A JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions to accelerate JPEG compression and decompression on systems with popular CPU architectures, such as x86-64, Arm, and PowerPC. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as libjpeg, all else being equal. In many cases, the performance of libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs. libjpeg-turbo is an ISO/ITU-T reference implementation for the JPEG image format.
